**Spring 2020 Embedded Linux Class. -- Final**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository documents my class work and projects done for **CPS342**

This branch contains the content for the CPS 342 Final.

Here I am aiming to create a live gauge of various data from my car using the **obd** Python library and a bluetooth obdII scanner. Further plans include a website that will log important data such as speeding, trouble codes, overheating, and so on. The current issue with that is I do not have the means of having internet connection in my car as of right now. 

Current status of the project is..

**Materials**

1\. ELM327 OBDII Scanner
  Please be mindful that this is infact an OBDII scanner with the ELM327 microcontroller, other OBDII scanners may not work. Does not have to necessarily be Bluetooth but it does make things a bit cleaner.
  
2\. Raspberry Pi 3B / 4
  You can get away with older, but in my case I am using the 4 and the built in Bluetooth makes things easier
  
3\. A screen for the Pi
  I am using a 4inch LCD Touchscreen from Miuzel for this project. Having a small screen with touch function makes things easier to debug and work with but not necessary.
  
4\. 12 volt power converter for the car
